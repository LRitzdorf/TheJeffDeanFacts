# The Jeff Dean Facts

## About This Repo

The "Jeff Dean facts" are a set of jokes that revolve around the extraordinary programming prowess of their [titualar Google employee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean). Simply put, they are the coding equivalent of Chuck Norris-style jokes (for example, "").

I first encountered the Facts on <https://ben.lobaugh.net>, though as of recently they appear to have been removed. Thus, in order to preserve this invaluable cache of programmer humor for posterity, I decided to create this repository. It is a combined list of various versions of the Facts, beginning with a text file that I copied from Mr. Lobaugh's blog sometime in 2019, when his post still existed. It's been expanded from other sources, which are listed (and linked, if possible) at the end of this document.

And now, without further ado...

## Endnotes

1. It's not clear whether this fact is *really* true, or whether this line is simply part of the joke, so I've omitted the usual `(TRUE)` identifier here. Interpret this as you see fit :)
